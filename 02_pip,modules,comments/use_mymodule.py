# Since we have created our very first module name mymodule.py 
# Now lets use it and before using it make sure this file and module are in same folder

import mymodule #importing our module
x=mymodule.add(4,5)# calling the function named add() which is inside module name mymodule and storing its value in x
print(x) # printing value of x in console/terminal

# we will learn in detail about modules in later chapter. Lets remind this much for now.
