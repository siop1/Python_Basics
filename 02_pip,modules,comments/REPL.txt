REPL stands for Read,Execute,Print and Loop.

When we need to test some small codes then we can type python in terminal/console then REPL will open
and we can write some codes to test.We can do some arithmetical calculations.

But if alot of code is needed to write then we need to use text editors or IDE like vscode,sublime text,
etc.
