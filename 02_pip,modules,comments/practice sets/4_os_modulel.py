# WAP to print the contents of a directory using os 
# module.Search online for function which does that.

# note: + sign is used to concatenate similar datatype
# for ex: str + str or int + int
# we have to add space between quotes to create space between two string

# comma is used to concatenate any datatypes in print() function
# comma automatically creates space between string as well as numbers
# it is more convenient to use then + sign to concatenate
# but i have used + sign in some of the program to demonstrate how inconvenient it is to use + sign
