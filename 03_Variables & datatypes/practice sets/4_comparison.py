# Use a comparison operators to find out whether a given variable a is
# greater than b or not

a=30
b=50
# Since we have not studied if else till now so i will use simple approach

print(a>b) # return  boolean either true or false so in this way 
# we can find out if a is greater than b or not

# Once we learn if else statement than we can write like this and make it 
# more interesting. Check the code below

# if(a>b):
#     print("a is greater than b")
# else:
#     print("b is greater than a")
