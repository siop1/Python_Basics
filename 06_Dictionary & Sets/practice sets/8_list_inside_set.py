# _list=[1,2]
# _list[0]=4
# print(_list)

# Can you change the values inside a list which is contained in set s ?
# s={8,7,12,"Aryan",[,2]}

s={8,7,12,"Aryan",[1,2]}
print(s)

''' note: first thing first we can't store list in
set. Although we can store tuple inside set but we
can't change it.

'''
conclusion: if we can't even store list in set then
changing the value is beyond the topic.
