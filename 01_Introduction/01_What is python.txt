Python is simple,readable,fast programmable programming language.
It is a interpreter based programming language because it executes codes line by line.
It doesnot use {} in function and indentation is used to say these codes are under this function.
It doesnot use semicolon as we move to next line it automatically mark this as new code.
We donot have to manage memory in python unlike memory need to be managed in c language.

I have good knowledge of C language so I think I will learn the python faster.
